    <mark>Machine Learning</mark> is a branch of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms by learning the hidden patterns of the datasets used it to make predictions on new similar type data, without being 
        explicitly programmed for each task. Traditional Machine Learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output that can be used to make actionable insights.

        Machine learning is used in many different applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, 
        portfolio optimization, automated task, and so on. Machine learning models are also used to power autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, making them more intelligent and adaptable to changing environments.</p>
